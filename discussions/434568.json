I recently found you, and I really appreciate it. A quick question: I assume that it is possible to have an array of the triangles (maybe a new class) where we can have each triangles centroid, area, and maybe some properties like rendering fillcolor that can later be associated with a specific state for that triangle when used in another application. <br />\nJust wanted to know if it is already there and I am overlooking it, or if not, your suggestion for the most efficient way to doing that (using your existing Trinagle, and Rendering programs). I am familiar with c# (and programming) so, feel free to have a short answer. I do not want to waste your time.<br />\n<br />\nThank you again for the good work!<br />\n<br />\nBy teh way, forgive me for not starting a new thread.<br />\n",
