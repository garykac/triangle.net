What am I doing wrong?\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, what are the possible values for the Boundary property?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you and best regards,\r<br />\nRodrigo Basniak<br />\n",

    "Html": "If you want to get the boundary edges only, I suggest you use the <code>mesh.Segments</code> property.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen building the input geometry, you can add a boundary mark to a segment, <code>geometry.AddSegment(int p0, int p1, int boundary)</code>. This mark will be the value of the segments <code>Boundary</code> property, so you can easily distinguish between different boundary parts in your application.<br />\n",
