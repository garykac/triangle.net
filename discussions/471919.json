Do you have a vertex lying in the middle of a segment? Triangle sometimes copes poorly with that sort of thing. Do you want to lay out a collinear row of evenly spaced, segment-connected vertices? <strong>Have you simply defined one long segment connecting the leftmost vertex to the rightmost vertex, and a bunch of vertices lying along it?</strong> This method occasionally works, especially with horizontal and vertical lines, but often it doesn't, and you'll have to connect each adjacent pair of vertices with a separate segment. If you don't like it, tough.<br />\n</blockquote>\n",
