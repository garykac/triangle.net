    "Html": "I've been using the Triagle.NET classes to mesh some geometry generated by my own code. I ran across a frustrating problem, where, triangulation would (seemingly randomly) fail with errors.\r<br />\nTo test what was happening, I output my geometry to a .poly file, and ran it in the Mesh Explorer, where, without fail, it would mesh every time.\r<br />\nAfter some investigation I discovered that it was related to the number of significant figures in my numbers. A double will use 17 significant figures, but when it's output to string it gets truncated to 15 sig figs by default. So the .poly files would always have 15 sig figs, and would always mesh properly, while using 17 sig figs is hit-and-miss. I updated my code to truncate the last two significant figures from my coordinates, and, lo-and-behold, it stopped crashing.\r<br />\nMight be worth investigating for future updates.<br />\n",
