    "Html": "wo, thanks so much for your help. \r<br />\n<br />\nI have another two related questions, so I open another thread.\r<br />\n<br />\nHow can I avoid adding additional vertexes to my boundary.  Also, I added a set of vertexes into the polygon, after smoothing, those points are moved.  I want those points fixed in the domain to simulate some structures.  For example, I added some dense points in the floodplain of rivers to simulate side channel.  How do I can better quality of mesh using smoothing or other functions while fixing those vertexes.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks.\r<br />\n<br />\nVictor<br />\n",

    "Html": "I think that I got it after your suggestion.  Can you explain a little bit about vertex and edge marks?  Originally I did not have any marker on the edge, and I still have split segment on the boundary.  After I added a marker (5) on the edges, no additional vertex was added.  Can you give me an explanation of the markers.  For vertex, if it is &gt;0 it is fixed and for edge if it is &gt;0 it is a boundary.  Am I right?<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks. <br />\n<br />\nVictor<br />\n<pre><code>// Add the points.\npoly.Add(new Vertex(0.0, 0.0)); // Index 0\npoly.Add(new Vertex(3.0, 0.0)); // Index 1 etc.\npoly.Add(new Vertex(3.0, 3.0));\npoly.Add(new Vertex(0.0, 3.0, 1)); // Add a marker, fixed point?  why do I need this marker?\npoly.Add(new Vertex(1.0, 1.0));\npoly.Add(new Vertex(2.0, 1.0));\npoly.Add(new Vertex(2.0, 2.0));\npoly.Add(new Vertex(1.0, 2.0));\n\n// Add the segments.

    "Html": "No. Thanks for reporting. It's a bug in the smoother code. It doesn't copy the mesh settings. Try the latest source code.<br />\n<br />\nEDIT: regarding the markers: generally, it's just a means of identifying items in the mesh. For example, if you're doing FEM and have different boundary conditions, just add a different marker and you can easily identify them when assembling the linear system.<br />\nThe smoother is just another example of using markers to distinguish fixed from free vertices.<br />\n",
