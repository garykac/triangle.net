As the points are updated so is the mesh / voronoi diagram \r<br />\n<br />\nFor example, here is the grid in the center\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5041720/Screenshot%202014-07-17%2011.28.19.png\" alt=\"Image\" /> \r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHere, I've moved it to the right:\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5041720/Screenshot%202014-07-17%2011.28.55.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\n<br />\nCurrently I'm just triangulating all the points then creating a new voronoi diagram. Obviously, this is really expensive as every update includes a load of unnecessary calculations. This : <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/javascript-voronoi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/javascript-voronoi/</a> has done something similar in javascript - I think it's a bespoke algorithm.. \r<br />\n<br />\nAny feedback greatly appreciated \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\n<br />\nR<br />\n",

    "Html": "I have no plans to add this, but it should be straightforward to do. There are actually only two things to take care of:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Use an efficient spatial index (like a Quadtree) to find the Voronoi cell that contains the new vertex (should be O(log n))</li>\n<li>\nUpdate all affected cells (should be O(k), k the number of affected cells, usually O(1)). If you google &quot;incremental Voronoi&quot; you'll find details, for example in <a href=\"http://students.info.uaic.ro/~emilian.necula/vor2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://students.info.uaic.ro/~emilian.necula/vor2.pdf</a><br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nThe javascript code seems to do exactly that, using a winged edge datastructure instead of DCEL.\r<br />\n<br />\nBTW: the new Voronoi code should be safe to use by now and I'd be glad if someone would test it :-)<br />\n",

    "Html": "The first bit sounds easy, the second a little more challenging ! will give it a go :) \r<br />\n<br />\nThe link makes sense, however math formula is a little over my head - are there any Triangle functions that'd make my life a bit easier? (eg: getting affected cells, calculating new boundaries etc) \r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPS: I'm testing it the code now :) Had to make a few small changes to get it working. Will dig out my notes later - the one I remember off the top of my head was line 125 of Rectangle.cs being changed to:<br />\n<pre><code>   public void Expand(IEnumerable&lt;Vertex&gt; points)\n        {\n            foreach (var p in points)\n            {\n                Expand(p);\n            }\n        }</code></pre>\n\n.. If i remember correctly, it was still using the older Points class. <br />\n",
