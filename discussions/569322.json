Is there any other documentation ? \r<br />\n<img src=\"http://s1.postimg.org/6hp6yk7tb/Capture.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\nThank you very much for your help.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Documentation of the <code>ITriangle.Area</code> property may be a bit sparse here, but it says &quot;Triangle area constraint&quot;. This means that it is used as input, e.g. you have a mesh and want to refine a selected set of triangles, you can set the area constraint for those triangles and refine the mesh.<br />\n<br />\nYou will have to write the code by yourself, but it's fairly easy.

It's the way the original Triangle code works and it's straightforward ...<br />\n",
