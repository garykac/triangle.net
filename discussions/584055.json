If I download the source code however, I get quite a different library. Is this the Beta 4 version that is announced in the documentation? Or is it an &quot;intermediate&quot; version that might have some issues and Beta4 is not released yet? Also, is the work on Triangle still ongoing?\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers<br />\n",

The Voronoi code was completely rewritten, but should be stable and much more accessible, due to the introduction of DCELs.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo my recommendation: use the latest code!<br />\n",
