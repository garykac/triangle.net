Simply I should be able to select all points on the some geometry edge and calculate boundary equation in it. So there is the question - how to select all points that belongs to the one particular edge?<br />\n",

    "Html": "First, you should use boundary markers in your input geometry (at least if you have to apply multiple boundary conditions). Any segment of the mesh has a <code>Boundary</code> property, so you can easily identify different boundary parts.<br />\n<br />\nTo access the boundary information you have two choices:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nSegment based:<br />\nYou can use the <code>mesh.Segments</code> property and loop over all the segments. You can use the <code>GetVertex(i)</code> method to get the segment endpoints and <code>GetTriangle(i)</code> to get the triangle(s) the segment belongs to.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nTriangle based (preferred)<br />\nSince you usually assemble the system matrix by looping over the elements (<code>mesh.Triangles</code> property), you can call <code>GetSegment(i)</code> [i=0,1,2] for each triangle. If it returns null, the triangle side is not on the boundary. If it is, it returns a segment and you can look at its boundary marker to find the boundary condition you want to apply. Then use <code>GetVertex(i)</code> to get the vertices and do the actual integration.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nYou can use the <code>vertex.ID</code> property for indexing your matrix entries. If don't use any custom numbering, you can call <code>mesh.Renumber()</code>, which will ensure that vertex ids are numbered linearly from 0 to N-1 (assuming the final mesh has N vertices).<br />\n",
