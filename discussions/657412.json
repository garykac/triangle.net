However, most of examples and questions about this lib is drawing 3d meshes and diagrams. I need only result of calculation.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have three points with their own X and Y coordinates and I need to calculate coordinates of fourth point. I have three distances which tells me how far fourth point is located from each of them.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs it possible to pass coordinates and distances and retrieve new point by using this library? <br />\n",
