    "Html": "Hello, I have a similar problem and I am not sure exactly how to solve it.<br />\nI use an InputGeometry to add points to, and then try to triangulate it with a mesh as in your example.<br />\nThe only difference is that I don't have segments, because (if i understnd this correctly) my input is not a polygon<br />\nbut just a collection of points.<br />\nThe triangulation is fine but i get some extra (and very large) triangles around the edges as shown in the picture.<br />\nIs there a way to fix this? Am i missing some option perhaps?<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/holmsmt105l0sb0/points.png?dl=0\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/epd8zu9ikd8oq46/result.png?dl=0\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n",
