I'd love to have those as well.<br />\n<br />\nBonus question would be if you could pick a commit I could tag as &quot;beta 3&quot;, as I tagged the topmost as beta 4.<br />\n<br />\nBest would be if you would maintain the main repository at GitHub, so I could technically fork it, and reference into my projects from there.<br />\n",
