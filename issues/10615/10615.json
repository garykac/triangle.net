    "Description": "> Doesn't the Voronoi calculation have to take into account neighbouring points in order to form its regions? If so, wouldn't there be a way of snagging the points at that level?\n\nSure. Just have a look at Voronoi.cs, Line 162:\n```c#\n// Go counterclockwise until we reach the border or the initial triangle.\nwhile (f_next.triangle != Mesh.dummytri)\n{\n    // Add circumcenter of current triangle\n    vpoints.Add(points[f.triangle.id]);\n\n    // [...]\n\n    f_next.Copy(ref f);\n    f_next.OnextSelf();\n}\n```\nThe ID of vertex _f.Apex()_ is actually the ID of the neighbouring Voronoi cell (across the edge _points[f.triangle.id]_ -> _points[f_next.triangle.id]_). This information could easily be stored in a Dictionary<int, VoronoiRegion> (the bounded Voronoi case could be quite a bit more complex, though).",
